# DiskSchedulingAlgorithms
Disk scheduling algorithms implemented in C++
Directions: 
  Function declarations are located on lines #35-56
  Main body is located on lines #62-75 (Variable: init_head_value represents the starting index.)
  NOTICE: The main body is partially commented out, uncomment the desired algorithms that you want to run.
  So far all disk scheduling algorithms are fit for user input. If you would want a random generation of requests, please       adjust the respective disk scheduling algorithms.
            
  Change the variable in the aforementioned functions to the proper parameters: GENERATE_REQUESTS, USER_INPUT_REQUESTS,         or PRESENTATION_DEMO.
  
EXAMPLE: 
  You decide that you want to run the C-LOOK algorithm with 1000 random requests.
  You go to the function definition (ctrl find: C_LOOK).
  Change line 560 to accept parameter: GENERATE_REQUESTS.
  Uncomment out C_LOOK function and adjust init_head_value to your desired starting position.
